    <h4>Q. Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains 
        a heading and two paragraphs of text.<br/>
        Use the HTML tags &lth1&gt, &lt/h1&gt, &ltp&gt 
        and &lt/p&gt in this exercise.<br/>
        As the texts in the heading and paragraphs you can 
        use any texts you like.<br/>
        Add an unordered list to this web page.<br/>
        An unordered list can be specified with the tags &ltul> and &lt/ul>.
        An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be 
        specified with tags &ltli> and &lt/li&gt.<br/>
        After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens 
        when you convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags &ltul&gt and &ltul&gt with 
        &ltol&gt and &lt/ol&gt, respectively.<br/>
        Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the 
        &ltimg&gt tag.<br/>
        As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the 
        Internet.

    <h2>What is a database?</h2>
    <p>
            A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information, such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.

            Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. They collect information on people, places or things. That information is gathered in one place so that it can be observed and analyzed. Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.
