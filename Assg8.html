            7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. 
You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into 
the same folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html 
page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html 
when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use 
the &lta&gt and &lt/a&gt tags in this exercise. Inside the tag &lta&gt you need to use a
href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.

            8. HTML tags like &lta&gt can have certain attributes. The href attribute is 
                mandatory in the &lta&gt tag. Additionally, it is possible to use the title attribute 
                which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a 
                link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the 
                previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when 
                the mouse cursor is over the link.

       Databases

    <p>
        Formally, a "database" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to this data is usually provided by a "database management system" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.

Because of the close relationship between them, the term "database" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.

Outside the world of professional information technology, the term database is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.
